## Physical Properties of Fiberglass Grating

Understanding the physical properties of fiberglass grating is crucial when considering it for your specific application. Below, we outline the key physical characteristics of our **fiberglass grating**:

- **Corrosion Resistance**: Fiberglass grating is inherently resistant to many corrosive substances, including most chemicals, acids, salts, and solvents. This makes it ideal for use in harsh environments such as chemical plants, wastewater treatment facilities, and coastal areas.
  
- **High Strength-to-Weight Ratio**: Despite being lightweight, fiberglass grating provides exceptional strength. It has a higher strength-to-weight ratio compared to metal alternatives, allowing for easier handling and installation while maintaining durability.

- **Non-Conductive**: Fiberglass grating is a non-conductive material, making it a safe choice for electrical and electronic environments where grounding is important.

- **Lightweight**: Fiberglass is significantly lighter than metals like steel, reducing transportation and handling costs. This is particularly advantageous in large-scale projects where weight is a concern.

- **Fire Resistance**: Our fiberglass grating meets **Class 1** fire ratings, ensuring that it performs well in high-heat environments and is compliant with fire safety regulations.

- **UV Resistance**: The UV-resistant properties of fiberglass grating allow it to withstand prolonged exposure to sunlight without degrading, making it ideal for both indoor and outdoor applications.

- **Customizable Sizes and Configurations**: We offer **customizable grating sizes** and configurations, ensuring that our products can be tailored to meet the specific needs of your projects.
