## Physical Properties

Fiberglass grating boasts exceptional physical properties, which make it the preferred choice for demanding industrial applications. Here are the key physical properties of our fiberglass grating:

### 1. **Strength and Durability**
Fiberglass grating is designed to withstand heavy loads while maintaining structural integrity. The composite construction of fiberglass and resin provides excellent strength-to-weight ratios. With a high compressive and flexural strength, it can bear significant weight without deformation.

### 2. **Corrosion Resistance**
One of the major advantages of fiberglass grating is its superior resistance to corrosion. Unlike metal gratings, fiberglass grating does not rust or degrade when exposed to harsh chemicals, saltwater, or other corrosive substances. This makes it ideal for use in chemical plants, offshore platforms, and marine environments.

### 3. **Lightweight**
Fiberglass grating is much lighter than traditional metal grating, making it easier to handle and install. This reduces the labor and transportation costs associated with installation and maintenance.

### 4. **Slip Resistance**
Our fiberglass grating is available with various surface finishes, including grit, serrated, and smooth. The grit and serrated options provide excellent slip resistance, ensuring safety even in wet or slippery conditions.

### 5. **Non-Conductive**
Fiberglass grating is non-conductive, making it a safe choice for use in electrical environments. This property is particularly important in power plants and other industrial settings where electrical hazards need to be minimized.

### 6. **UV Stability**
Our grating is UV-stabilized, making it ideal for outdoor applications. The resin used in the manufacturing process is formulated to withstand prolonged exposure to UV rays without degrading or losing strength, which increases the lifespan of the product.

### 7. **Temperature Resistance**
Fiberglass grating can withstand extreme temperatures, from sub-zero conditions to temperatures as high as 250°F (121°C), making it suitable for use in hot environments such as power plants or steel mills.
