## Physical Properties of Microporous Grating Panels

Microporous grating panels offer a unique combination of properties that make them ideal for a wide range of demanding applications. Here's an overview of the key physical properties:

### 1. **Advanced Filtration Capabilities**
The microporous design of these grating panels provides exceptional filtration performance, effectively capturing particles and contaminants as small as 0.2 microns. This makes it an excellent solution for applications such as wastewater treatment, filtration systems, and other environments where high-performance filtration is critical.

### 2. **High Strength-to-Weight Ratio**
Despite being lightweight, our microporous grating panels are designed to withstand high levels of stress and heavy loads. The combination of fiberglass and specially formulated resins results in a grating that offers impressive mechanical strength without the burden of heavy weight, allowing for easy handling and installation.

### 3. **Corrosion and Chemical Resistance**
These panels are highly resistant to corrosion, even in aggressive environments. Whether exposed to acids, alkalis, solvents, or saltwater, our microporous grating panels retain their integrity, making them ideal for applications in chemical plants, marine environments, and water treatment facilities.

### 4. **UV and Weather Resistance**
Our microporous grating panels are UV-stabilized, ensuring they perform reliably even in harsh outdoor environments. They resist degradation from prolonged exposure to sunlight, making them an excellent choice for exterior applications, such as walkways and drainage systems in coastal or high-altitude areas.

### 5. **Fire Safety**
Our microporous grating panels are manufactured with fire-resistant resins, providing Class 1 fire ratings according to ASTM E-84 standards. This makes them a safe choice for environments where fire safety is a top priority, such as in chemical processing plants and industrial complexes.

### 6. **Temperature Resistance**
The panels can withstand temperatures up to 250°F (121°C), which makes them suitable for use in high-temperature environments such as power plants, steel mills, and hot water treatment facilities.

### 7. **Non-Conductive**
Fiberglass is an inherently non-conductive material, making our microporous grating panels safe for use in electrical environments where accidental electrical contact may occur. This property ensures enhanced safety for personnel working around electrical equipment.
